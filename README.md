# 1emank

Hi, I'm Carlos. I'm learning programming, mostly Bash, Python and Rust, and I'm
interested also in C and Java.

Although I'm learning programming to find a good job, I've always been
interested in videogames, so I'll probably work in one eventually.
Professionaly or as a hobby.

In this personal repo, you can see `dotfiles` which is a git submodule
containing some of my config files, and `install.sh` a script that installs
those files. Namely:

- .bashrc
- .bash_profile
- .config/nvim
- .config/stylua.toml
- .tmux.conf
